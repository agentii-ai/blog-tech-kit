# Step 4: Tasking methodology

Step 4 corresponds to the **tasks.md / `/blogkit.tasks`** phase in Spec Kit, but focused on **blog driven growth for an AI/LLM SaaS product**, not on code implementation.

Where `plan.md` (Step 3) defines *strategy and plan* (objectives, wedge, channels, growth loops, experiments), this step turns that plan into an **executable task list**:

- Clear phases and milestones.  
- Concrete tasks and subtasks.  
- Owners and collaborators.  
- Checkpoints, reviews, and tests (PDCA cycles).  
- Enough structure that a small team can run it like a project.

This is the blog/growth equivalent of a `tasks.md` file for a feature.

## 5. Perplexity research prompt

Use the prompt below in Perplexity (or similar tools) to gather **best-practice tasking and execution patterns** for blog driven growth an AI/LLM SaaS product from blog plan to day-to-day tasks and sprints.

```prompt
you are an expert writing tech blog and growth operator with deep experience in ai/llm saas and agent products (2023–2025), and a background in pragmatic project management.

context:

- step 0–3 in my blog-tech-kit have already produced: an overview of blog for ai saas, principles and patterns, a blog-focused spec (personas, problems, hero workflows, constraints, success metrics), and a non-technical blog plan.md (objectives, strategy, launch/activation, growth loops, metrics, risks).
- now i want to create a **tasks.md** focused on execution and tasking for blog and growth, not on engineering implementation (no stacks/architecture).

please extensively research **recent (2023–2025)** playbooks and examples on how successful ai/llm saas products and high-performing silicon valley teams:

- break their blog and growth plans into **phases, tasks, and sprints**
- use **product-led growth, growth hacking, and virality** in a structured, project-managed way
- define **owners, milestones, checkpoints, and PDCA loops** for blog experiments
- manage tasks across product, design, growth, content, and community for an early-stage ai saas or agent product

focus on concrete practices and case studies from tools such as cursor, claude code, devin, manus, lovable.dev, runway, pika, heygen, photoroom, harvey, writer.ai, canva, figma, notion, and similar products.

for each relevant source or pattern you find, extract key questions and answers about:

- a proposed structure for a blog-focused **tasks.md** (phases, task groups, ownership, checkpoints, exit criteria)
- examples of concrete tasks for ai saas blog work (user research, launch campaigns, growth loop experiments, community building, metrics reviews)
- guidance on using **PDCA (plan–do–check–act)** and sprint cadences to iterate on blog experiments
- suggestions on how to incorporate social channels (twitter/x, reddit, product hunt, linkedin, youtube, tiktok, discord) into the task list in a disciplined way

present the answer as a markdown document that i can adapt directly into `step 4: tasking methodology` and a `tasks.md` file in my blog-tech-kit.
