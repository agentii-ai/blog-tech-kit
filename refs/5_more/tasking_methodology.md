# Blog & Growth Tasking Methodology for AI/LLM SaaS
## Phases, Sprint Cycles, Owners, Checkpoints, and PDCA Loops (2024–2025)

---

## Executive Summary

This document provides a battle-tested tasking framework for executing blog and growth strategies at early-stage AI/LLM SaaS companies. It translates high-level strategy into concrete sprints, tasks, owners, and measurement loops—based on how Cursor, Lovable, Anthropic, LangChain, Notion, Figma, and other high-growth companies actually execute.

**Core Principle:** Blog growth isn't about publishing—it's about orchestrating discovery, community engagement, content creation, and distribution as integrated systems. This requires project discipline: phases, sprints, owners, checkpoints, and feedback loops.

## Part 1: Blog & Growth Execution Framework

### Overview: Four-Phase Execution Model

All successful AI/LLM SaaS blog programs follow this rhythm:

```
Phase 1: FOUNDATION (Weeks 1-4)
└─ Strategy lock, team onboarding, systems setup, measurement infrastructure

Phase 2: LAUNCH (Weeks 5-8)
└─ Publish first authority content, activate initial distribution, begin community engagement

Phase 3: AMPLIFICATION (Weeks 9-16)
└─ Scale content production, activate growth loops, run distribution experiments

Phase 4: OPTIMIZATION (Weeks 17-24)
└─ PDCA cycles, measure and double down on what works
```

## Part 11: Avoiding Common Execution Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Tasks Without Clear Owners
**Problem:** "Research content ideas" assigned to "team"
**Solution:** Every task has ONE accountable owner. Even collaborative tasks need one owner making final calls.

---

### Mistake 2: No Checkpoints Until Deadline
**Problem:** Task due in 2 weeks; no progress check until deadline
**Solution:** Break tasks into smaller sub-tasks with daily/end-of-week checkpoints

---

### Mistake 3: No Measurement of Task Completion
**Problem:** "Publish post" marked done, but no measurement of impact
**Solution:** Every task has measurable exit criteria and a metric

---

### Mistake 4: PDCA Cycles Skipped
**Problem:** Execute for 4 weeks, then "time for strategy update"
**Solution:** Weekly, monthly, quarterly PDCA cycles built into task structure

---

### Mistake 5: Too Many Concurrent Experiments
**Problem:** 10 growth loops running simultaneously; no clear winners
**Solution:** Run 1-2 focused experiments per sprint, measure fully, then iterate

---

## Conclusion: From Strategy to Execution

Strategy without tasks is wishes. Tasks without PDCA are guessing.

This framework connects:
- **Phases** → structured progression from foundation to optimization
- **Sprints** → 2-week cycles with clear completion
- **Tasks** → atomic units of work with owners, durations, checkpoints
- **PDCA** → continuous learning and iteration

Use this as your project management backbone for blog and growth execution.
