## Recommendations

### High Priority (Both Documents)

1. **Add Estimated Hours Aggregation**
   ```markdown
   ## Sprint 1 Effort Summary
   | Phase | Tasks | Hours | Owner |
   |-------|-------|-------|-------|
   | Research | 7 | 15 | Writer |
   | Drafting | 12 | 30 | Writer |
   | Review | 8 | 12 | SME |
   | Copyedit | 12 | 22 | Editor |
   | Publish | 15 | 10 | Marketing |
   | Measurement | 11 | 12 | Marketing |
   | **Total** | **65** | **101** | **Mixed** |
   ```

2. **Add Risk Tasks Per Sprint**
   ```markdown
   - [ ] **T1-R01** (Risk): Check for competitor posts on target keyword
     - If found: Pivot angle within 48 hours
     - Owner: Marketing
   ```

3. **Add Content Refresh Tasks**
   ```markdown
   - [ ] **T1-REF-001** (Month 4): Evaluate Post 1 for refresh
     - Check: Ranking position, traffic trend, competitor updates
     - If ranking dropped: Revise outline, update examples, re-promote
   ```

### For Spec-Kit Tasks

4. **Add Explicit Dependency Column**
   - Convert checkbox format to table with Dependencies column
   - Example: `| T1-007 | Write main post | Writer | 15 hrs | T1-003, T1-006 | Draft complete |`

5. **Add Role Effort Breakdown**
   - Calculate total hours per role across all sprints
   - Validate against team capacity (FTE allocation from plan.md)

6. **Expand Sprints 3-5**
   - Provide full task breakdown for Posts 3-5
   - Or create template that can be instantiated per post

### For Agentii Tasks

7. **Add CI/CD Code Validation Task**
   ```markdown
   | S0-XXX | Set up GitHub Actions for code example validation | Tech Lead | 2 hrs | S0-001 | Python/JS code blocks auto-tested on PR |
   ```

8. **Expand Sprints 3-5 Fully**
   - Provide complete task tables for Posts 3-5
   - Current "follow identical structure" reference requires mental mapping

9. **Add Core Web Vitals Tasks**
   ```markdown
   | S0-XXX | Verify Core Web Vitals targets | Tech Lead | 1.5 hrs | S0-003 | LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1, Lighthouse 90+ |
   ```

---

## Task ID Scheme Comparison

### Spec-Kit Scheme

```
T[Sprint]-[Sequence]
Examples: T0-001, T1-007, T2-019, T-PS-004
```

**Pros:** Simple, sequential  
**Cons:** No phase visibility in ID

### Agentii Scheme

```
S[Sprint]-P[Phase]-[Sequence]
Examples: S0-001, S1-P1-001, S1-P2-005, MEAS-015
```

**Pros:** Phase-aware, hierarchical  
**Cons:** Longer IDs

**Recommendation:** Agentii's phase-aware scheme is better for sprint/phase planning visibility.

---

## Parallel Execution Visualization

### Spec-Kit Approach

```markdown
**[P] Parallel markers**: Research phases can begin while prior sprint is in Publish/Measurement phase.
```

### Agentii Approach

```
Sprint 1 (Week 3-8): Post 1 Drafting + Publishing
    ↓
Sprint 2 (Week 9-14): Post 2 Drafting + Publishing
    ├→ While Sprint 2 Phases 4-6, Sprint 3 can start Phase 1 (research)
    ↓
Sprint 3 (Week 15-20): Post 3 Drafting + Publishing
```

**Verdict:** Agentii's ASCII diagram is more actionable for planning sprint overlaps.
