## Blog Type Declaration

**Blog Type**: Authority + Practitioner Hybrid

**Rationale**: Position kits.agentii.ai as the canonical authority on spec-driven development and job kit methodology, while also providing immediate practical value through tutorials and how-to guides. The hybrid approach establishes thought leadership (Authority pillar blogs) while driving engagement and adoption (Practitioner implementation guides).

**Content Strategy Alignment**:
- **Authority Pillar Blogs**: Deep research on spec-kit patterns, job kit abstraction methodology, cross-domain applications (6-12 month authority-building ROI)
- **Practitioner How-To**: Step-by-step guides for building custom kits, implementing spec-driven workflows (1-3 month quick-win engagement)
- **Combined Goal**: Build long-term authority while driving immediate traffic and product adoption

**Product Connection**: These articles drive product adoption by showing readers exactly how to implement spec-driven workflows. Lower search volume (1K-3K) but higher purchase intent. Each guide includes link to kits.agentii.ai resources and implementation guides.

**SEO Strategy**: Target "how-to" and "guide" keywords specific to each audience. Include video tutorials or step-by-step screenshots for engagement. Optimize for featured snippets and "People Also Ask" boxes.

---

### Pillar 4: Original Research on Spec-Driven Workflows

**Description**: Publish original research, case studies, and data about the effectiveness of specification-driven approaches. This establishes authority through evidence, not just explanation.

**Example Topics**:
- Survey Results: How Teams Currently Plan (And Why It Fails) - Original Research

- The Spec-Kit Ecosystem Report: Who's Building Kits and What Works
- Open Source Contribution: Constitution Generator Tool (Open-Source Release)
- Failure Analysis: Why Spec-Kit Implementations Fail (And Lessons Learned)

**Product Connection**: Original research establishes kits.agentii.ai as thought leaders in the methodology space, not just repackagers of GitHub's spec-kit. Generates major backlinks and citations from industry publications.

**SEO Strategy**: High-effort, high-reward content. These pieces take 6-12 weeks per article but generate sustained authority and backlinks. Target branded + methodology keywords (e.g., "spec-kit research," "specification ROI," "team productivity benchmarks").

---

### Pillar 5: AI-Augmented Specification Workflows

**Description**: Explore how AI agents can interpret, refine, and execute specifications. This bridges spec-kit methodology with modern AI tools and Claude Code, tying back to kits.agentii.ai's core offering.

### Edge Cases

- **Content Outpaced by Competitor**: If GitHub updates spec-kit docs with similar pillar content, our posts remain valuable through job kit extensions and cross-domain focus (differentiation point)
- **SEO Ranking Plateau**: If post doesn't rank page 1 within 4 months, conduct technical audit and consider content refresh or repurposing as guest post
- **Viral Post Drives Low Conversion**: High-traffic posts with low newsletter signup analyzed for CTA placement and messaging; refresh post within 2 weeks
- **Negative Comments on Social**: All comments addressed within 24 hours; establish editorial response policy (transparency over defensiveness)
- **Outdated Content**: Pillar Blogs maintained on quarterly review cycle; "last updated" timestamps visible; refresh if methodology changes or citations change

## Example Pillar Blog Post: "What is Spec-Driven Development?" (Authority - Pillar 1)

### Title & Meta
- **Title**: "What is Spec-Driven Development? Complete Mental Model for Technical Teams"
- **Meta Description**: "Complete guide to spec-driven development. Learn the 4-file architecture that reduces ambiguity and accelerates delivery. Compare to traditional development."
- **Target Keyword**: "spec-driven development" (search volume ~5K, moderate competition)

### TLDR
Spec-Driven Development (SDD) inverts traditional software development by making specifications executable. Instead of writing code first and documentation second, SDD defines clear specifications upfront—constitution, requirements, plan, and tasks—that guide AI agents and human developers. This reduces ambiguity by 60%+ and accelerates delivery through systematic execution.

### Content Structure
1. **Problem**: Why do so many engineering projects miss deadlines or deliver with rework?
2. **Root Cause**: Ambiguous specifications, miscommunication between roles, scope creep
3. **Solution**: Spec-Driven Development framework with 4-file architecture
4. **How It Works**: Constitution → Spec → Plan → Tasks → Implement (with examples from different professions)
5. **Results**: Case study showing 50% rework reduction, team adoption, outcomes
6. **Key Takeaways**: 5 core insights readers can apply immediately
7. **Next Steps**: Link to "How to Write Better Specifications" and "Building Your First Kit"

### SEO Elements
- H2 sections: "The Problem: Why Specifications Fail," "The Solution: 4-File Architecture," "How Spec-Driven Development Works," "Real-World Results," "Getting Started"
- Internal links: 5-6 to other pillar blogs (Pillar 2, 3, 5 posts)
- External backlinks: GitHub spec-kit repo, AI tooling articles, engineering blogs
- Code examples: YAML specs showing constitution, plan structure
- JSON-LD schema: Complete Article metadata with author, date, keywords
- Related posts: Sidebar with 5-7 links to implementation guides and job kit examples
